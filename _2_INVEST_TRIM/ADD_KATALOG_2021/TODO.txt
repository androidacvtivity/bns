1.1 CREATE TABLE USER_BANCU.KAT_2_INVEST_TRIM - I created table.  
1.2 I imported data from excel file to table. Without problem.
1.3 I must checked metadata and and if it is necessary I must corrected they. 
1.4 We checked the metadata in the catalog and added the appropriate metadata for each row or statistical unit that corresponds to the current classifiers. 
1.5 I have created another table and I will enter all the corrected data in it.  
1.4 We checked the metadata in the catalog and added the right metadata for each row or statistical unit that corresponds to the current classifiers. 
1.5 I have created another table and I will insert all the corrected data in it in all columns but in column (CUIIO_VERS) I insert version which I needed. (1048).
1.6 Now I have the new catalog for the statistical report for the period I needed, with all the data in all the columns, which are right.    
1.7 Now I will  checked current catalog for this statistical report. I will verified version of each statistical units for period which I needed.

1.9 Now I will check version for each statistical units. For new catalog it is necessary will be version 1048 for each report (CUIIO). 
2.0 Task #2181_step5.sql Each statistical units from catalog have this version (1048) for first trimester for 2021 year. What is right. 
If there are statistical units with different versions. It is necessary to enter in the catalog statistical units with the default version. (1048)
2.1 Now I will check the new catalog with the new version with the main table (RENIM) on a  two columns. On a column CUIIO and column CUIIO_VERS.
2.2 In the main table are not - 1007 statistical units with such a version. (Task #2181_step6.sql)
2.3 Now we need to check if in the maximum version for the quarter these are statistical units with versions smaller than 1048. Task #2181_step7.sql
